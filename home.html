    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Iâ€™m a passionate and self-driven Computer Science student at Rongo University, with a strong interest in software development, web technologies, and problem-solving using code. I enjoy building user-friendly web applications and continuously exploring new tools and technologies in the tech space.

Throughout my academic journey, I've gained practical experience in programming, version control with Git, and front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am currently expanding my knowledge in backend technologies and cloud computing.

My goal is to become a skilled software engineer who builds solutions that are not only functional but also meaningful and impactful in everyday life.</p>
